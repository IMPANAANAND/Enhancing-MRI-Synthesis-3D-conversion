# Enhancing-MRI-Synthesis-3D-conversion

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for synthesizing knee MRI images and exploring 3D MRI conversion techniques.

## Overview

**knee-mri-synthesis.ipynb** demonstrates methods for synthesizing knee MRI scans, potentially using deep learning or image processing techniques, and explores how to convert 2D MRI data into 3D representations. This project aims to advance medical imaging analysis and could be useful for researchers, radiologists, or students interested in medical image synthesis and 3D visualization.

## Features

- Loading and preprocessing knee MRI data.
- Exploring data augmentation and synthesis techniques.
- Demonstrating 3D conversion or visualization methods for MRI data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (install with pip):

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-image nibabel
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IMPANAANAND/Enhancing-MRI-Synthesis-3D-conversion.git
   cd Enhancing-MRI-Synthesis-3D-conversion
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook knee-mri-synthesis.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the notebook cells to reproduce the synthesis and 3D conversion workflow.

## Repository Structure

- `knee-mri-synthesis.ipynb` â€” Main notebook demonstrating the workflow.
